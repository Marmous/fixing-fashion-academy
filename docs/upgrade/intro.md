# Techniques
| Upgrade|      Description    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
|<img src="../assets/upgrade/upgrade_resize.jpg" width="150" height="150"/>| <img src="../assets/temp/icon.png" width="30" height="30"/> <br> **Resize**   <br> This is a very simple repair where you only use stitches to repair your rip. Donâ€™t need much, but not super long lasting repair.      |
|<img src="../assets/upgrade/upgrade_remake.jpg" width="150" height="150"/>| <img src="../assets/temp/icon.png" width="30" height="30"/> <br> **Remake** <br> Similar to the stitch repair but here you add some extra fabric. This makes it very strong and durable but also quite visible.     |
|<img src="../assets/upgrade/upgrade_recolor.jpg" width="150" height="150"/>| <img src="../assets/temp/icon.png" width="30" height="30"/> <br> **Recolor** <br> This is to cover edges from a broken area. Like the edges of a sleeve   |

You could make it almost invisible if you use the same yarn, or show of the repair with another color    |
