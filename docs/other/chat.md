Fixing Fashion is part of [One Army](https://onearmy.earth), a group of people trying to tackle global problems. We use Discord to chat, learn from each other and answer questions. Besides the practical stuff its also a great place to meet like-minded people and get inspired by other projects. I mean plastic is fun but there is more to discover!
