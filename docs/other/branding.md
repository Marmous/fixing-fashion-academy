### Icon
Logos are a strong way of spreading a brand. You carry an icon and spread it around and people can start to recognise it. We made these logos very powerful. The same blue shirt could have a completely different feeling depending on the logo on there. It's impressive how many people carry and promote a brand that pushes overconsumption. We don't produce or sell any clothes, but you can still be part of our movement. Add a logo to your clothes and show with pride what you support. Repairing, upgrading and caring for your clothes. Show the real love and care you put in your clothes, not the money you spent on it.

### DIY Icon
There are several ways to add a logo to your clothes. Here a few tips to make it look real. Use a basic running stitch, easy to add by hand or machine. Use red yarn. And add it to places where you would expect a logo. This helps people to understand it's a brand you carry. If there is already a logo, just go straight over it like the image below. It shows that the original brand is irrelevant, it's just a piece of textile that needs to be cared for, and you are doing it. And make sure to share your logo on Instagram with #fixingfashion.

### Logo, colors and typeface
In case you need it, here you can download the .svg file from the Fixing Fashion logo. Feel free to use it for whatever you need, we are easy :). The color we use is #F82F0, The font we use is Open Sauce [(download)](https://github.com/marcologous/Open-Sauce-Fonts) . In case you were wondering, the logo itself is 2 f's i.e. FF (FixingFashion) stitched together. And the icon itself is based on a # (hashtag) which is a crucial part of this project. To share and promote your repaired and upgraded clothes.
