### Icon
Logo's are a strong way of spreading a brand. You carry an icon and spread it around, get other people familiar with it. We made these logos very powerful. The exact same blue shirt could have a completely different feeling depending on the logo on there. It's impressive how many people carry and promote a brand that pushes overconsumption. We don't produce or sell any clothes, but you can still be part of our movement. Add a logo to your clothes and show with pride what you support. Repairing, upgrading and caring for your clothes. Show the real love and care you put in your clothes, not the money you spend on it.

### DIY Icon
There are several ways to add a logo to your clothes. Here a few tips to make it look real. Use a basic running stitch, easy to add by hand or machine. Use red yarn. And add it to places where you would expect a logo. This helps people to understand it's a brand you carry. If there is already a logo, just go straight over it like the image below. It shows that the original brand is irrelevant, it's just a piece of textile that needs the be cared for, an you are doing it. And make sure to share your logo on #fixingfashion.
