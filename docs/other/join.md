#fixingfashion relies heavily on people joining the movement, we continue to create the tutorials and knowledge. But we need people actually using the information. There are 2 ways to do this:
1. **Use the knowledge.** Repair and upgrade your clothes. Make sure clothes get used as long as possible. Join on Discord if you need help or have questions.
2. **Promote.** Share and inspire others to join the movement. Show the world with proudness that you care for your clothes. Use #fixingfashion on Instagram and spread it around. This is very important for the movement to grow.

### How to contribute
The best thing you can do at this early stage of the project is promoting by sharing the project with your friends, family or followers. Let them know there are ways to keep your clothes longer! This is very important for the movement to grow.
