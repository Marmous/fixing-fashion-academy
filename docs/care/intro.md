#  1. Introduction (workspace setting)
## 1.1 Why care?
Hello. In this chapter we are going to show you the most basic starting point of producing less waste from the clothes. By making sure you can keep the clothes you already have longer.  For instance by having the right washing settings so they wear out less or how to remove a stain like red wine and in general by understanding the basics of the material. It sounds boring. But we basically wear clothes everyday, but know very little about them.. And because of this many garments are broken or thrown away unnecessary fast. Watch this video to learn how to extend the lifetime.   

## 1.2 Make a link with Basics  
This video is part of a series of videos that will show you how to care for your clothes, later we go into how to repair them or how to upgrade. Would recommend to watch the ‚Äúbasics of clothes‚Äù first to make sure you understand the principles behind textiles, sewing, etc.  

#   2. Stains (table with ingredients and stains)  

## 2.1 Intro Alicia
Ok let‚Äôs start. Lets say you have a stain. Red wine, or tomato sauce, pen ink fruit. What should we do now? I dunno, so Alicia is going to explain you how to deal with this!  

## 2.2 Fast  
Ideally when this happens take care of it as soon as you can! Letting it dry or soak into the fabric will make it much more difficult to clean. So act fast! Identify the spot, see whats on there and check what mixture you need.  

## 2.3 Ingredients  
The ingredients and mixture you need depends on the stain is different each time. However most of it can be done with 9 basic ingredients. Bile soap/Ox gall soap, Distilled vinegar, Baking soda, Tooth Paste, Table Salt, Hydrogen Peroxide, Green Soap/Dishwash soap, Lemon. Most of mixtures is a combination of these ingredients. We‚Äôve made a list in the academy that gives an overview of what mixture to use for what stain  

## 2.4 Cleaning  
So once we know our mixture it‚Äôs time to clean.  
Few tips here. Never rub, always dab it in the same fibre direction. This will make sure you won‚Äôt wear out the textile on that specific spot. When you are in doubt or still figuring out what is the stain, rinse or soak in lukewarm water before treating or laundering. Once the stain is out. Let it to dry. Or you can fully wash your clothes, so next chapter. How to wash properly.  

#  3. Prepare Washing (in front of pile clothes)
## 3.1 Intro  
Washing itself is quite an important one to avoid your clothes wearing out fast. A few simple changes in your washing routine can make a big difference over time. But in order to see what we can improve we first need to understand whats going on.
## 3.2 Washing labels  
The washing labels are simple icons that give you clear instructions on how to treat and wash your garment, You can find them mostly in the label of your tshirt. I‚Äôm sure you have seen them before  There are actually a lot of variations of these icones but there are 5 main ones..   
wash, bleach, tumble dry, iron and dry clean.     
You can find more detailed information about these 5 and all the others in the academy.  They are the easiest way to find out how to wash your garments. However sometimes the labels are missing and you need to figure it out yourself.  

## 3.3 Plant/animal/oil Based  
In the Basics video we discussed that there are different types of fibres. Plant based, Animal based fibres and Synthetic fibres are. If you want to know more in detail about that topic make sure to watch the basics video. Anyway its also important for washing, because some of these fibres need to be treated gently and some are easier to use.  Roughly **Plant based** like cotton and hemp are pretty easy to wash, oil based fibres like polyester even easier . But you really need to watch out with **Animal based** like wool and silk require a lot of care. But I can imagine this all sounds a bit abstract. So let me give you a few specific examples  

## 3.4 Examples  
**Wool**. (animal based) Wool, alpaca, cashmere, mohair and angora do not readily absorb body odour and need little washing, but when they do begin to accumulate odours you can put garments into direct sunlight for several hours. Using sunlight to clean clothing items is a practical tradition that dates back as long as humans have worn these fibres. If there is a need to wash. Its best to do it by hand on low temperature, and when it comes out when let it dry flat, if you hang it it will stretch everything  

**Silks** (animal based)  are prone to discolouration and should be cleaned after every wear. Cleaning requires a lukewarm wash and either need to be ironed inside out or hung wet outside. Adding a little bit of vinegar with some orange peels when washing, helps maintain the softness of the silk.


**Leather** (animal based)  needs to be maintained with grease. Use some old underwear as your grease cloth and rub it in with a circular motion. This also applies to jackets and shoes. If the leather starts to lose its colour, you can buy coloured grease. Suede can be cleaned using a brush, or! old bread. Good natural sponge. Rub it into the suede directly. Pro tip: make sure to do this outside as it can leave a bit of a mess, but some food for the birds..


**Cotton Jeans**  (plant based) When dealing with 100% cotton jeans, you ideally don‚Äôt want to wash them. Because of the twill weave jeans/workwear, it makes it a strong workable fabric that over time adjusts to your body shape. By washing them jeans lose their fit and if there is elastane (mostly in skinny jeans) they will become less durable. One way is to maintain jeans/workwear by putting them in your freezer in a plastic bag for two days. This kills the bacteria and its odour and stains can be spot cleaned.


**With swimwear** (oil based)  or rash guard clothing always wash them out immediately after use with lukewarm water and biodegradable soap. Because either the chloride from the pool or salt from the ocean tends to wear out the fibres much more.


**Fleece** (oil based) is good to wash inside out so it doesn‚Äôt create fluff balls. Overal clothes tend to leave fibres behind when washing, not a bad thing. But with oil based fibres they are basically micro plastics.  Specially fleece is very fluffy. So only wash those when needed to prevent pollution. If you wash turn the garment inside out and ideally put it in a Guppy bag that holds most of the microfibres. It also prevents the sweater from pilling  


## 3.5 Colors

After you are aware of the washing guidelines based on your garment's fibres, it‚Äôs good to sort your washing on colour. There's more to the sorting game than just keeping dark garments away from the gleaming whites. The secret is mixing and matching items into loads that need similar soaps, detergents, wash cycles and water temperatures. Without a doubt, smart sorting is the way of ensuring clean results - wash, after wash, after was

## 3.6 Conclusion

So overall washing has a lot of variables. It depends a lot on which material is used (cotton or plant based), which technique, for instance the same piece of cotton lingerie and cotton jeans require different washing. And on top of that  you also have different colors to sort. And here is also where you realise we make our wardrobe very complex. Having so many different materials, techniques and colors in our wardrobe.

#  4. Detergents (Kitchen table setting)
## 4.1 Intro detergents  
There are many detergents out there; Liquids washing detergents, Powder washing detergents, Fabric softeners, Stain removal, Whiteners/Bleachers, Colored, Black wash, Washing shells, Washtabs. As you can imagine with of more fabric qualities you need more kinds of specific detergents for each thing. However this is practically impossible for an average person with many mixed mixed clothes and materials. So deciding which detergents you need is hard decision making. But here a few tips and trick  

## 4.2 Quick tips  
Quick go for detergents is using fragrance-free, phosphate-free, and biodegrading soaps to eliminate endocrine disruptors in our environment  

## 4.3 Eliminate fabric softeners   
Eliminate fabric softeners all together, and instead, use a ¬Ω cup/ 200 ml of white vinegar during the rinse cycle. This not only takes the stains away, but also brightens white and colored wash, kills bacteria and removes little soap rests in your clothes and even the machine. Both will go longer in the cycle and will be more durable. Next to that it will be cheaper for your wallet.   

## 4.4 Black & White  
Than you still have the choice of black, white and colored washing detergents. They are all there to take ultimate care of your clothes and to go with you for a longer period. But buying all those detergents is sometimes quite an investment. One key thing though. Don't use white detergents for colored or black as they contain bleach and that is not something you.  

## 4.5 DIY detergent  
The simplest and cheapest option is making your own detergent. This gives you the freedom to know exactly what is in your detergent. If you want to know more check out the article down below. Next to that you use vinegar with some oranges for as a stain remover and holding the white colors and black colors alive.   
Baking soda can be used as a whitener. If you want to add a fragrance, add some essential oil in to the detergent drawer, but not straight into the machine as it can cause stains, if comes directly on your garments.  

#  5. Final checklist washing (washing machine)
## 5.1 Reduce washing  
Try to wash your clothes as little as possible. Most clothes don't need to be washed after every wear. The more you wash them, the more they lose their quality.   

## 5.2 Low temperature  
Wash your main clothes around 30 degrees. This temperature not only requires less energy, but it is also better for the fibres as the fabric doesn't undergo the added stress of overheating.   

## 5.3 Empty Pockets:   
You don‚Äôt want any ‚Äòto-do list paper pulp‚Äô on your clothes that takes an hour to remove. Or a screw that rips your pocket. (This sounds like this has happened to me before) So empty pockets before you wash your clothes.   

## 5.4 Zippers and buttons:   
If you don‚Äôt close zippers they zipper might be stuck into the other a garment, and could make a little rip in fragile fabrics. Open all buttons and hooks to prevent them from ripping off the fabric.


##  6.0 Drying (outside near clothing rack)
Introduction  
After sorting and washing your clothes there comes the drying and ironing. Its seems the most straightforward thing, but even here there are a few tips and tricks to take in account.  

## 6.1 Best way to dry, outside  
The best way of drying clothes is outside, it free and doesn‚Äôt cost energy. But also the UV in the sunlight does a bit of extra cleaning to the bacterias. Drying outside is a practical tradition that dates back as long as humans have worn clothes. This should be your default approach.  

## 6.2 Using the dryer  
What about the dryer? Well It does come out nice and soft but it has a few downsides. Consumes a lot of electricity. Your clothes spin around which creates friction and wears out your fabrics faster. And the heat has a negative effect on the fibres of your clothes. So we advise to only need it if you are in a rush or something.
## 6.3 Avoid ironing

Also preferably don‚Äôt use an iron, only when it‚Äôs really needed like on special shirts for your wedding. First it takes a lot of energy and second, when you iron, you‚Äôre using heat to loosen fabric fibres and press them flat. The fibres in the fabric don't like this pressing and unfortunately. Using too much heat on delicate fabrics can completely ruin them, melt them or leave a nasty yellow burned stain.  So if you do use the iron make sure you always use the right heat level for the type of fabric you‚Äôre ironing and to be cautious always iron from the inside. So what if you do want to iron. The temperatures for each fabric can be found on the machine. Irons with a proper steam function are best. Because sometimes the steam function is enough to get the wrinkles out so you don‚Äôt need to press the fibres.

#  7. Storage (near wardrobe)
## 7.1 Clothing bags  
Crucial things for a wardrobe is something wherein clothes are not exposed to dust or UV light.  If your wardrobe is open make sure that clothes that are only worn for special occasions or that you don‚Äôt wear often. For instance  your summer clothes in winter, that they are stored in a clothing bag or make it use an old plastic bag or box. This makes sure that your clothing doesn‚Äôt fade because of too much exposure of UV light on one side or because moths will slowly eat them up.   

## 7.2 Moth Balls  
Storing the things you don‚Äôt often use in a bag or box help to prevents moths from eating them. However you might still want something in your wardrobe but ideally it doens‚Äôt smell like a chemical public toilet. So instead of using those balls you can also use cedar wood.

## 8.0 Next step repairing (workspace)
