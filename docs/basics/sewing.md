First of all, your sewing doesn't need to be beautiful, but it does need to be durable.  This is so your seams last and you don't have to constantly repair the same problem over and over again. Eventually, we hope you make something that shows your hard work and the pride you take in your repairs. You're proud that this shirt did not end up in a landfill or a container. That you bought it because you liked it and so you have taken responsibility for it and the precious care it deserves.

Understanding the basics of sewing is vital for the art of repairing and upgrading. These basics will help you deliver quality results which will stop you from having to repair the same issue over and over again. Sewing looks easier than it is. But it is mainly a thing you need to continue to practice to get better at; it is a skill like many others. So, we will help you through this process of trying and failing so that you can become a master of the craft.

Before you start sewing you need to know what yarn you are going to sew with.



# Tools
Some tools you really can’t work without for sewing are. (Examples + Illustration)
1.  good pair of sharp scissors: These are extremely crucial. If you sew a lot you know how important a pair of sharp scissors are. Possibly as important as a good working sewing machine.
2. Pins & Pin Cushion: Lazy sewers don’t like them, but in the end, you work faster with them because they keep everything in its place and you don’t take the risk of taking the seam out again as it wasn’t in the right place. Preferably the ones with a round-tipped glass head as they are easier to use. It is nice to keep track of them, whether that be in a box or pinned into a little pillow or even easier a magnet. Magnets are great to use as you can pick up fallen pins and stick to it.
3. Needles: There is a huge variety of needles but with every how-to, we will tell you which ones are best for the job. Small-eyed needles are used for delicate fabrics. Bigger eyed needles are used for strong durable fabrics. Long needles are mostly for embroidery and repairing techniques. Short thin needles are for normal sewing. Middle-fat needles are more for thick/leather fabrics. Hand sewing needles have the eye at the top of the needle. (Illustration)  Machine needles have the eye at the bottom. Machine needles follow the same standards as hand sewing needles but are numbered. The higher the number, the bigger and stronger the needle. For one technique you need felting needles, these are needles that have intersecting hooks that feel the wool fibres together more about this in the Repair section. Note; Always check if the needle is blunt with a test fabric, cause a blunt needle might cause damage to the fabric or skips the stitches. (Illustration)
4. Measurement Tape & Set Square: Measurement tape is needed to measure body shaped surfaces. A set square helps measure out a patch or a pattern, with 90 degrees or any sharp corners.
5. Seam Ripper: Seam Rippers are to remove stitches. This tool is to undo all the mistakes you may make or the seams of a garment. It has a V shape where the inside can be used as a knife to rip the thread.
6. Sewing Machine: A machine is necessary if your patch requires strong stitches or when you need to finish fabric neatly. A modern machine may not produce a higher quality stitch but may have more functions and options and save you more time. If your machine can already do some strong stitching with a straight or zigzag stitch you are mostly good. Old machines can be just as good as new ones as long as you take care of the machine.
7. Embroidery Ring and/or Darning Egg/Mushroom: Not crucial for sewing jobs, but definitely nice for repair jobs. An darning egg is preferred for the darning technique instead of the embroidery ring as you have a base underneath that keep it tight. Embroidery ring is preferred for decorating and the edge mend.



# Stitches
After knowing the tools and knowing what kind of yarn you can use for what technique. You need to know what stitch to apply for what sewing job. We explain here the one you can later on use for specific repair jobs or upgrading techniques. There are two different methods of sewing: hand or machine. Neither method is superior. It depends on what the fabric is (Knitted or Woven, Delicate or Durable, etc.) and where your stitch is placed on the garment. 



## Stitching by Hand 
Stitching by hand can be done when you can’t reach a place in the garment very well or when you don’t have a sewing machine nearby.
Needle set- up: Put your yarn/thread through the eye of the needle and leave the end of the thread in your hand while you hold the needle (Illustrations). Only double lace the thread when you need to sew on a button or beads for extra strength. (Illustrations)

1. **One or Two-Loop Backstitch Knot:** A stitch to start and to finish your main stitch. On the sewing machine it is called a Back Stitch. To make a One-Loop backstitch knot, take a small backstitch on top of your last stitch By picking one thread of the main fabric. Then create a loop with stitch, and draw needle ones or twice through the loop. Pull the thread through tightly to close the loop and make a knot. Make a second one-loop knot for a Two-Loop Backstitch knot which requires extra security. Clip the thread. (Illustration)

2. **Basting stitch + Running stitch:**
The difference between the Basting stitch and the Running stitch is the spacing of stitching. For both push the needle through the fabric stitch by stitch. Straight, in one direction, up and down. The stitches can be seen alternately at the top and bottom. The Basting Stitch is a widely spaced stitch that can easily be removed is sometimes an aid to keep something in place so it is easier for the sewing machine to go over it. With this a Cotton Basting yarn is used, which you can easily break. This is for instance done when you can’t really pin something like a patch, because there are too many layers you are working with or when you need to resize something you can try it with pins or with a basting stitch to see how much you need to take out. (Illustration)
A Running Stitch is a more closed spaced stitch and is therefore a stronger stitch. It is used a lot in patchworking, embroidery and sashiko repairing. More about this in the Repair section. (Illustration)

3. **Backstitch:**  Good stitch to replace the sewing machine stitch with, if you don’t have a sewing machine near you or you are on the road and you need to attach something quick. The Backstitch works the same as the normal/running stitch on your sewing machine. (Illustrations ) When you started with a One or Two Loop Stitch. You start your backstitch by putting the needle in after a two stitch length and lift the needle in your work. Reinsert one stitch back and repeat after two stitch lengths again. Work from right to left and end with a Double Looped Back Stitch.

4. **Ladder Stitch:** The ladder stitch is used for closing seams that are opened or are snapped. It is a great stitch if your seam is ripped on the seam and you can only close it back by hand. You can also use it as an invisible ‘Stitch repair’ in the middle of the shirt without any patch underneath. But we don’t recommend this on places with a lot of friction or tension, also you see a little fold and it won’t be a very strong repair. In those places you rather want to use a repair with a patch, as there will now be folds in the main fabric. More about that in Repair. Start 0,5 cm off from the edge of the rip or start under the folded seam and continue under the fold of your seam a step further back to the edge of the fold. Cross to the opposite fold edge and end with your needle under that fold. Grab a little bit of fabric of the fold edge underneath the fold. Jump again to the other side and continue working on the edges of the fold till the seam or rip is closed again.

5. **Catch Stitch/Blind Hem Stitch:** A stitch identified by its criss-cross stitches, this versatile stitch is great for front-facing fabrics, circular garments (That you see from both sides) and tablecloths. This one is used as an embroidery stitch, and can be visibly used, we called it than a Catch Stitch and is mainly used to finish edges or to finish a folding visible.
An invisible version of this stitch is called a Blind Hem Stitch and is good to hem the edges of your pants or skirt. This stitch is perfect to fix a hem that has come out or when a garment has been resized, made shorter, and it needs a new invisible hem.
This is recommended for skirts, dresses or trousers or for lining from a coat.
(Illustration + Example) The catch stitch is sewn from left to right. A basting stitch picks up some fabric from the front fabric, 2 threads is enough (Do not pierce from the right side), Cross back  and pick a stitch wide from the fold. The threads must cross. Do not sew it too tight as it will make the stitch visible, if you want it to Hem and want it to be invisible. Finish it with a Double Looped Back Stitch Knot.

6. **Overcast Stitch:** With these stitches you can finish the edges of a fabric and secure it from unravelling. It can also be used as a visible Stitch repair or to make a garment smaller and give it an esthetic accent. This is a good stitch for small knitted fabrics like t-shirts or to attach Velcro back on or a pocket that is loose in the corner. (show example in Illustrations). Start with a knot and start stitching over the rip two times over the same place. Bring the needle through the fabric from back to front again. With each stitch, the needle should always come through in the same direction. As you add stitches, the thread should be wrapping around the edge of the material. Keep the same distance between the stitches for a neat look.

7. **Blanket Stitch/Buttonhole Stitch:** The Blanket Stitch is a stitch used to reinforce the edge of thick materials. It is a decorative stitch used to finish an unhemmed blanket or edge. The stitch can be seen on both sides of the fabric. The Buttonhole Stitch, is a closer spaced Blanket Stitch. You can repair a buttonhole from where the thread is unravelling and is now ripping further and getting bigger, causing the button to fall out of the hole every time. You can use the buttonhole stitch to embroider around a rip and leave the rip open, creating the Edge Mend. (show example in Illustrations)
It works the same as an overcast stitch, but you put your needle back in your stitch, so it gets this cover on the side. With the next stitch, you pick up the stitch that is crossing, so it covers the side again. Depending on where the stitch is placed is how wide the stitch should be spaced out.

8. **Chain Stitch (Embroidery):** There is a wide variety on Embroidery stitches, The Chain Stitch is our favourite as you make drawings or create words with it which are quite visible. Examples you can find in the Upgrade section, under Decorate. (show example in Illustrations) The Chain Stitch is created by making a Back Stitch. By going forward you loop the yarn your stitch with over the needle, when it’s creating a stitch forward, as you see in the example. Then go back in the last stitch, to eventually go forward again from there and then wrap the yarn over it again. Continue like this till you create a Chain looking stitch.
 
These are the stitches we use so far now in the Repair and Upgrade Section. Other stitches will be later explained with adding more techniques to the website.


## Stitches by Machines
Stitches by machine are a little bit more different as they are seen as functions on the machine and are mainly explained in your manual of your sewing machine. New machines have different functions for stretch stitches or even embroidery stitches. With every machine it’s different, some stitches are better suited for different sewing projects and it makes your work neater, so better take an hour to read that manual.  The main stitches you should know:  (Illustration)

1. **Backstitch :** This is the reverse button on your sewing machine, as it retraces the stitch. This is to secure a stitch from unravelling and is applied in the beginning and at the end of the stitch. You can also apply this for the Stitch Repair or Zigzag Repair. (Illustration)

2. **Running Stitch:** Is the most known stitch on every sewing machine, the straight stitch, that identifies itself as the back stitch in hand sewing. Simply a good and durable stitch when a seam is ripped and stitch it back or to repair woven fabric. The Running stitch is not recommended for stretchy knitted fabrics, as the stitch snaps if it needs to stretch with the fabric. A Running stitch with a Double Needle can be applied on knitted and woven fabrics. This is for hemming T-shirts or other knitted Tricot fabrics.

3. **Zigzag Stitch:**  A stitch for stretchy or knitted fabric as the zigzag stitch stretches with the fabric or you can apply this stitch to simply strengthen a patch on a woven fabric. A closed spaced zigzag is a good way to finish the edge of a fabric. 

4. **Tricot Stitch:** Than modern machines consist of Tricot/Stretch stitches,  it’s good for finishing the hem of a T-shirt or small knitted/tricot fabric, but it’s mainly there to create stretchy seams for knits. Check for this one the manual of your machine as well, as the stitches and functions differ. 

5. **Buttonhole:** Check for this function, your sewing machine manual as well.
Mostly you need a buttonhole foot and the button making function on your sewing machine. If you don’t have a sewing machine or you do have a sewing machine but without this function, check out the hand sewing options. The buttonhole should be 0.2mm larger than the button. When you are happy with your buttonhole stitch, you can rip the fabric in between with a seam ripper. Redoing a buttonhole with this function is not that easy, and is advised to repair by hand.
