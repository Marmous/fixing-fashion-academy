#  Fabrics overview
There are different ways to spin the fibres eventually into yarn, but we are not going to deep into that, although this does have an effect on how the fabric will turn out. Fabrics can be made by creating a Knit, a Weave or a Non- woven. Leather and fur are also considered and used as a fabric.


(ðŸ“¸examples of 5 different types)
|Type of fabric| Often used in:|
|----|----|
|Knitted| t-shirts, socks|
|Woven| Pants, jeans, blouse, shirt|
|Non-woven| Towels
|Leather | Jacket, purse|
|Fur| Coat, scarfs|


### Knitted
Knitted fabrics are characterised by their stretchiness and their comfort. Let say the opposite of woven fabrics is knitted fabrics. Knitted fabrics are created by loops that are interlocking with each other, and therefore secure each other.
â€¨Because of these meandering loops, the fabric can be easily stretched in different directions giving knitted fabrics greater elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 600%. For this reason, knitting is believed to have been developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motion, such as socks, hosiery and sportswear. A knit can always be recognised by its stretch and the loops.



### Woven
Woven fabric is any textile formed by weaving. Woven fabrics are often created on a loom or a loom machine. A good one to characterise woven fabrics is to follow the horizontal or vertical lines that are overlapping and interlacing each other.  Woven fabrics donâ€™t stretch much or not at all vertically and horizontally, They will only stretch diagonally on the bias directions (between the warp and weft directions)or when there is a percentage of elastane yarn added into the fabric.


### Non-wovensâ€¨
Non- woven fabrics are fabrics created by fibres or filaments that are composed together by chemical, thermal or mechanical treatments. These are not composed into yarn first but straight into fabrics. The fabrics are thick and isolatingâ€¨There are three main non-wovens fabrics:
- Fibre fabrics, which are used to strengthen a woven fabric or as a lining, or to make a fabric thicker, as a filling for Quilts for instance.â€¨
- Felt, created by friction, heat or pressure, like felting, needle felting or tufting. Used in Fleece jackets or felted jackets.
- Composed fabrics; coated fabrics, with a weaving underneath or loose threads that keep the coating together. Used a lot in raincoats.â€¨t is also possible they already exist as a fabric made of a filament, like leather or rubber.
Both woven and non-woven do not stretch as easily as knitted fabrics, which can make knitted fabric advantageous for many uses.â€¨



### Leather and Alternative leather
Leather is made from the skins of sheep, goats, calves, pigs, wild animals (deer, deer, etc.), exotic animals (snake, crocodile, etc.) and fish (rays, sharks). 95% of leather is a by product of the meat industry.â€¨ With the rise of environmental and societal concerns, as well as animal welfare an abundance of research and innovations popped up in leather alternatives.â€¨Popular alternatives of leather are: PU leather (pleather), Recycled Leather, Coconut Leather, Apple leather, Pineapple leather, Mushroom leather, Cork leather, Cactus leather, Wine leather and other plant based leathers which are mixed plant fibres. Some are more environmentally friendly and some are just an alternative for leather and are marketed as vegan leather and arenâ€™t  more environmentally friendly as they are not fully durable, some need a heavy chemical treatment and some are not fully compostable.  But they are a direction to a better and more sustainable, cruelty-free future.

### Fur
Since humankind exists we are using furs from animals.â€¨Animals where the fur from is used: Antilope, Astrakan, Beaver, Bizam, Breitschwanz, Squirrels, Rabbits, Lamb, Mole rat, Murmeltiere, Minks, Nutria, Ocelot, Opossum, Otter, Persianer, Petit Gris, Sealskin, Skunk, Foal, Foxes, Whitecoat and Wolf.â€¨Fur is and was mainly worn by necessity in colder climates, but since the last century with textiles improvements and climate change. Fur is in most places around the world, only used as a proof of wealth. Since the 80â€™s fur endured quite a discussion and as an alternative imitation fur came up. This is a cheaper, vegan version and the imitations are getting better and better.
