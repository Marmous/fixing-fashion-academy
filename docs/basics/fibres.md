So what are fibres and why is it good to know where your clothes are made of?‚Ä® Fibres are the base of where textiles are made of.‚Ä® It is good to know from what fibres your clothes are made of, as each fibre has its specific properties. Some shrink more than others. Some need little washing and some need extra care and need a specific soap.‚Ä® Knowing the origin of where your clothes are made is important to simplify the caring process, as they collectively have qualities that dictate washing, drying and storage. But also to give you insights on which ones are more durable and which are more sustainable overtime.

## üêë Animal based Fibres
Animal based fibres are known as the Protein Fibres, which are fibres mainly based from the fur, hair or excretions (like cocoons) from Animals. Fur and leather are animal based, but are not fibres, fabricated into fabric. Instead it is natural material that is used for clothing and needs a different process, therefore it is not in the overview. We discuss leather and its alternatives shortly in the Basics of Fabrics)


‚Ä®**Wool:** Wool is primarily the hair of sheeps. There are 1000 different breeds of sheep, but the most known and used one is the fine wool from the Merino sheep. Next to that the most popular ones are the more firm wool of the Cheviot Sheep and a Crossbred sheep which is in between the merino and the Cheviot fibre. The quality and the curl of the wool depends on the part of the body of the sheep. It is mostly popular because the fibre has a structure that can intersect, which is also known as felting.‚Ä®Lambwool comes from young sheep, it is generally much softer and finer than from older sheep.


**Mohair:**‚Ä®The hair of the Angora Goat is called 'Mohair' (Not Angora wool, which is from the Angora rabbits). The fibers are soft, highly shiny, little frizz and very resilient.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: Texas (USA), Turkey and South Africa


**Angora:**‚Ä®The hair from the Angora Rabbit. The hair is plucked or cut off. The fibres are very soft and very resilient. Be aware that a new cheap Angora sweater can be plucked, which harms the animal.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: China‚Ä®

**Alpaca:**‚Ä®Wool from the Alpaca. Used for expensive, fine fabrics. There are two types of Alpaca: Huacaya (which produce a dense, soft, crimpy sheep-like fiber), and the Suri (with silky pencil-like locks, resembling dreadlocks but without matted fibers).‚Ä®Biggest exporters: Peru and the Philippines

**Cashmere:** Wool from the Cashmere Goat. Very soft and quality material.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: Mongolia, Iran, India, Tibet, China en Irac.‚Ä®

**Silk:** Silk comes from the cocoon of the silkworm.
Biggest exporters: China, Japan, France, India and Italy


## üå± Plant based Fibres
Plant based are also known as the Cellulose Fibres. The name already says it, as the fibres are coming from Plants. Plant-based fibers come from the fluff from seed cases, from leaves, husk or from the stem/bast.

**Cotton:**‚Ä® Most common plant-based fibre is Cotton. Cotton is the seed fluff of the cotton plant, which comes out when the seeds are ripe. The quality depends on the length, gloss, and colour of the cotton depending on what country it is and the type of cotton plant.‚Ä®Biggest Exporters:  U.S, Uzbekistan, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan and Turkey. Organic Cotton: India, China, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan.


**Linen:** Linen comes from the Flax plant. This is an annual plant, which contains bark or stem fiber. The bark of the flax plant is made up of bundles of fibers (the technical fibers), which are held together by a glue called pectin. Due to its long fiber structure and a high content of waxy components, linen has a beautiful shine that is wash-resistant. The linen fiber is coarser, more irregular and longer than the cotton fiber, which makes linen stronger than cotton.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: China, higher quality: Belgium, Italy and Ireland


**Hemp‚Ä®:** Harvesting Hemp looks like the process of Linen, where both are a so-called bast fibre and need the retting process in order to win the fibre. Hemp is made from the stems of the hemp plant (cannabis sativa). It is one of the oldest fibres used for textile production. Because hemp is today widely appreciated as a sustainable fiber, it is now making a slow come back in Europe and the USA. Biggest exporters: France, Netherlands, Romania, Croatia, Hungary and Switzerland‚Ä®‚Ä®Used in: Pants, tops, accessoires, night gowns, shirts, preferably woven materials‚Ä®‚Ä®

**Ramie:**‚Ä®Ramie (Boehmeria niveau) the fibres come from the bast and are part of an everlasting kind of the Nettle family. Ramie is also called China grass, grass linen, grass cloth or China linen. As these names reveal, Ramie was cultivated first in Eastern Asia. Ramie fibers have been cultivated now for more than 5000 years. Ramie fabric has never really been widely used in the textile industry for Western countries, because the fabric is expensive and its processing is highly complex. In countries in Asia, such as Japan and China, ramie textile fibers are very popular.‚Ä®Biggests exporters nowadays: China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Philippines and Thailand


## üõ¢ Synthetic Fibres

Synthetic fibres are also known as oil-based fibres, because thats where most of them are made of. Synthetic textile raw materials consist of artificial or chemical raw materials, the 'polymers'. A polymer is a chain-shaped connection of molecules, also called a chain molecule.‚Ä®There are different types of polymers for textile raw materials, so that different types of synthetic textile raw materials can also be manufactured with different properties.‚Ä®The various types of synthetic textile raw materials have many similar properties, which is why we will first refer to textile raw materials in general and the various types will be supplemented as necessary. The main synthetic fabrics you can find in clothing are:


**Polyester‚Ä®:** Polyester is a manmade fibre that is derived from crude oil petroleum and is a non-renewable resource.  Accounting for nearly 50% of the global fibre production, polyester is the most widely used fibre in the apparel sector and mainly in the fast fashion industry, , as it is cheap and fast to produce and it is versatile. It is the same polymers used in PET bottles. A polymer is a chain-shaped connection of molecules, also called a chain molecule. If it is Recycled polyester (rPET), it is derived from discarded clear plastic bottles instead of raw petrochemicals. Polyester fabric recycling, where the actual yarn is recycled, is less common. In this case Polyester scraps and textiles are shredded and broken down into fibre components that are spun into yarn.‚Ä®Biggest exporter: China, Germany (rPET), U.S.A.‚Ä®

**Nylon/Polyamide‚Ä®:** Polyamide fabric is a general term that is used to refer to a variety of different fabrics that are made from strings of polyamide monomers. The most famous form of polyamide fabric is Nylon, which is branded by DuPont, but there are quite a few different varieties of this textile. While these types of fabrics are derived from carbon-based molecules, they are entirely synthetic, which means that they are inherently different from semi-synthetic fabrics, such as rayon, and fully organic fabrics like cotton. Nylon was originally developed by the DuPont Corporation in the mid-1930s as an alternative to silk stockings, which was very much a luxury item.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: U.S., China, Pakistan and India‚Ä®

**Acrylic‚Ä®(Poly-):** Acrylic (PAN) is lightweight, soft,  warm, with a voluminous wool-like feeling. It is mostly used to replace Wool or Cotton. Acrylic is artificially made by petroleum(oil) and is a kind of plastic. While acrylic fiber might contain smaller amounts of other synthetic compounds, this fiber must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile to be considered authentic. In the making of acrylic, it takes a lot of toxic chemicals and needs a lot of resources which makes this kind of synthetic fibers one of the worst in terms of environment.
Biggest exporters: Turkey and China‚Ä®

**Elastane/Spandex/Lycra:**‚Ä®Elastane(general term)/ Spandex (working term DuPont) and Lycra (branded name Dupont) all have the same process. This material is super stretchy and is very often mixed in with other fibers to make the clothing more elastic, both natural and other synthetic materials.‚Ä®Polyurethane elastomer, called elastomer for short, is usually processed as monofilament and has a built-in stretch. So it is not a natural rubber or a crimped synthetic material. Elastomers have better properties than rubber threads in most respects. Rubber has therefore largely been replaced by elastomers in the textile industry. Elastomers are lighter in weight, stronger, more durable and can be injected into thin filaments.‚Ä®Biggest exporters: China, U.S., India, Pakistan, Brazil‚Ä®


**Viscose and Modal** We can imagine that this one needs some explanation, like is it natural or artificial?‚Ä®Under Artificial Plant based fibres you see fibres where the base of the fibre is from origin Cellulose/Plant based such as wood pulp from Bamboo, Eucalyptus or Nettle, but the process of these fibres are highly chemical processes, to make them useful for wearable textiles. The end result is still plant based as it still contains Cellulose. The past few years a lot of innovation happened in this category to get more sustainable textiles with a cheap manufacturing price, so over the years a lot of improvements have been made, but these are the the most common ones nowadays:
