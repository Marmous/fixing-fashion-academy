Nice! So you want to bring your repairing and upgrading work to a next level. Therefore you need a little bit of insight into all the terms and how to apply them. Don’t worry this will just help you out with giving you less problems during your work and to give it a more qualitative side. 
We will teach you what the basics of fibres are, how fabrics out of fibres are made, and how you can make something wearable from fabric by hand or by machine and eventually how you can become part of our Fixing Fashion community.

No worries the more you sew the better you get at it. Later in the other videos, you will see how important it is to know a bit about fibres, fabrics and sewing. This knowledge will let you take better care of your clothes and have a deeper understanding of the caring process and how to maintain it by repairing or upgrading.
