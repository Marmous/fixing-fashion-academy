Hi Good to see you here! This is the academy section of https://fixing.fashion. Here you find the knowledge on how to repair, upgrade and care for your clothes. The best thing to do is watch the video for each section, and below you can find additional information, diagram and recipes on how to do this yourself. We create a few chapters to organise the things we can do with our clothes, these are the essentials. But more will come, this is an ongoing library of knowledge

### Join the movement

#fixingfashion relies heavily on people joining the movement, we continue to create the tutorials and knowledge. But we need people actually using the information. There are 2 ways to do this:
1. **Use the knowledge.** Repair and upgrade your clothes. Make sure clothes get used as long as possible. Join on Discord if you need help or have questions.
2. **Promote.** Share and inspire others to join the movement. Show the world with proudness you care for your clothes. Use #fixingfashion on Instagram and spread it around. This is very important for the movement to grow.


### Why are we doing this..
For several years the fashion industry has been under fire for the problems they create. Exploiting workers, sweatshops, overproduction, pushing consumption, polluting rivers etc. Problems have been addressed, and worked on. But always within the same framework. A company trying to make money of you buying something. Its time to have a try at a deeper fix. If you want to go more in depth about the problem go to the nextchapter.
