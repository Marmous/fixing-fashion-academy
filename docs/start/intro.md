Hi good to see you here! This is the academy section of https://fixing.fashion. Here you can find the knowledge on how to repair, upgrade and care for your clothes. The best thing to do is to watch the video for each section, and below you can find additional information, diagrams and recipes on how to do this yourself. We have created a few chapters to organise the things we can do with our clothes, these are the essentials. But more will come, this is an ongoing library of knowledge.

### Join the movement

#fixingfashion relies heavily on people joining the movement, we will continue to create the tutorials and knowledge. But we need people actually using the information. There are 2 ways to do this:
1. **Use the knowledge.** Repair and upgrade your clothes. Make sure clothes get used as long as possible. Join on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SSBrzeR) if you need help or have questions.
2. **Promote.** Share and inspire others to join the movement. Show the world with pride that you care for your clothes. Use #fixingfashion on Instagram and spread it around. This is very important for the movement to grow.


### Why are we doing this..
For several years the fashion industry has been under fire for the problems they create. Exploiting workers, sweatshops, overproduction, pushing consumption, polluting rivers etc. Problems have been addressed and worked on but always within the same framework. A company trying to make money off you buying something. It's time to have a try at a deeper fix. If you want to go more in depth about the problem go to the next chapter.

Fixing Fashion is an open source project. That's how we work. How it comes natural. We believe knowledge should be free. An asset for humanity that shouldn't have a price. We share all the outcomes of our research & development online. For the people. For the planet.
