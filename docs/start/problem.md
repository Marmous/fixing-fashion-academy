title: Whats the problem?
---

For several years the fashion industry has been under fire for the problems they create. Exploiting workers, sweatshops, overproduction, pushing consumption, polluting rivers etc. How is this still happening these days, why isn‚Äôt this fixed? Well the fashion industry is complex, its has a global supply chain and is trend related. Which is a model for income for many busniness around the world. There is a constant push for new clothes and collections. But lets dive into it step by step, start with the production



### üè≠ Producing clothes
Production of our clothes happens most of the time in developing countries. Wages are low, material costs less and there are less regulations and permits needed. Due to lower regulations there are a lot of cases of polluted water, exploited workers, unhealthy work conditions and eco systems being destroyed.  The main advantage for all of this that it‚Äôs cheaper. It makes it possible to produce clothes for a fraction of what it would costs in a developed country.  It is cheaper to produce clothes on the other side of the world ship it in a  boat and move it in trucks than producing locally in developed nations.


### üëï Consuming clothes
After clothes are produced and shipped to stores in developed nations they need to be sold. Selling clothes = money. So companies want you to buy more clothes. They do this by creating new collections. A new collection makes the previous collection ‚Äúold school‚Äù . Before collections where created once a year, then 4 times a year (each season) and nowadays 7 times a year. Fast fashion is a result from it.  They create new trends, make amazing campaigns, hire top actors each time, to make you buy more clothes. People dont replace clothes because they are broken, dont function anymore, or because they are much better. They replace them because they look like the latest trend.


### üóë Disposing clothes
Due to new collections we use our clothes for a short time. The looks gets outdated or our  trends change. So they go out of the door even though they still function properly, there is nothing wrong.  Thats why there are nowadays a lot of containers you can throw your clothes so they get recycled or reused by others.
- The harsh reality is that very little of our clothes get recycled, because they contain so many different materials. Polyester, cotton, Viscose, wool etc. You have shirts mixed with pants and pyamas. But also within clothes themselves we use different materials. For instance a  shirt can be a mix of 80% cotton, 10 Polyster and 10% viscose. This makes recycling very hard.
- Reusing and sharing clothes is a great option to increase the lifespan. But many second hand stores around the globe have a surplus of clothes, they get in more than they sell. As a result of this many clothes are shipped back to developing nations, like Ghana or Kenya. Where they are distributed on local markets. But due to this the local factories and clothing shops gets unfair competitions and slowly die. Making the countries depend on our waste.



### üìà The core of the problem
The topics above give an overview of the cycle of our clothes. There are things to improve in this supply chain, like making the production more sustainable, or making sure we can recycle them better. And these are important topics companies work on. They release a new collection that is organic, or ethical made. But they don‚Äôt tackle the fundamental problem.  They continue to fuel the engine of ‚Äúproducing more clothes‚Äù.  Clothes that weren‚Äôt needed in the first place. We don‚Äôt need more new clothes, at the moment the world has enough clothes,  for the comping decade. In shops, warehouses, outlets and our own wardrobes. It‚Äôs time to keep those valuable clothes longer, reuse them, take proper care of them.  This problems isn‚Äôt going to be solved by businesses that want to sell you more. it‚Äôs up to us, the people to make this move.‚Ä®   



### üí´ Solutions
The cool thing of fashion is that it can change. Its made by humans. The clothes we used to like 20 years ago now look silly, and if you look at the latest fashion show its hard to imagine you would ever where that. But you will. Companies fuel these trends and promote them. But just like companies fuel new trends, we can do it as well.  A trend for repairing, caring and upgrading clothes. Keeping them longer. So unlike companies, we don‚Äôt want to sell you anything. We want to opposite. We might not have  the budget to hire top notch actors, or billboards. But we can have people support. Nowadays everyone has a platform and can reach people with their social media. Share and inspire others to upgrade and repair clothes. Use your platform and spread this new trend.‚Ä®
